# Introduction

Machine learning is the study that allows computers to adaptively improve their performance with experience accumulated from the data observed. This series of courses would teach the most fundamental algorithmic, theoretical and practical tools that any user of machine learning needs to know. [Machine Learning Foundations](https://github.com/MichaelaTing/Machine-Learning-Foundations) focuses more on mathematical tools and is a prerequisite course of [Machine Learning Techniques](https://github.com/MichaelaTing/Machine-Learning-Techniques).
